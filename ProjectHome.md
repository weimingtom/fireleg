# Java Game Server (JAGS) 1.4 Released #

## JAGS 1.4m ##
The code is really looking good for developers that want to know about multiplayer games and physics.

Go play a game at http://fireleg.com or download the code from there.

You can benefit from the tutorials at my blog http://flexjavagames.blogspot.com/ and learn about only Actionscript 3.0, or go all the way and see how Java and Actionscript can work together.

Feel free to write games and I will post them on my public fireleg.com server for all to play.
